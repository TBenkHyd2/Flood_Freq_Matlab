Flood Frequency Distribution (FFD 2.1) is free software to analyze flood and estimate Quantile for Different return Periods and Flood frequency relations
Probability Distributions are:  
1-Normal Distribution              
2-Log Normal Distribution (2p)           
3-Gumbel Distribution
4-Racine-Normal Distribution                
5-General Extreme Values Distribution (GEV)
6-Gamma Distribution (2p)          
7-Log Pearson 3 Distribution         
8-Goodrich Distribution    
9-LogNormal (3p) Distribution
10-Weibull Distribution (2p)
